# Eat-Da-Cheese
Eat-Da-Cheese! is a food app that lets users eat all their favourite cheeses! 

* The user inputs the nameof cheeses they'd like to eat. 
* Whenever a user submits the name of a cheese, it will display the cheese on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 
* Each cheese in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. 
* When the user clicks it, the cheese will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every cheese in a database and whether its been devoured or not.
